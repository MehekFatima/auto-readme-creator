# auto-readme-creator

`auto-readme-creator` is a command-line tool that automatically generates a `README.md` file based on comments in your code files. It scans your project files for comments and generates a formatted README to help document your project.

## Installation

You can install `auto-readme-creator` globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g auto-readme-creator
```
if global installation fails you can use:

```bash
npx auto-readme-creator
```
## How to Format Comments for `auto-readme-creator`

To make the most out of `auto-readme-creator` and generate a well-organized `README.md` file, follow these guidelines for formatting comments in your source files.

**Comment Syntax**

1. Headings:
 - Comments that should become headings in the README file should be written without any special prefixes. Simply write your comment on a new line.
 - Example:
 ```bash
    // This is a heading
```
2. Paragraphs:
 - Comments that should be included as paragraphs under the preceding heading should start with the tilde symbol `~`. Everything after the `~` will be considered part of the paragraph.
 - Example:
 ```bash
   // ~ This is the first paragraph under the heading
   // ~ This is the second paragraph under the same heading
```
## Usage

After installing, you can use `auto-readme-creator` to generate a `README.md` file in your project directory. The tool will scan your source files and create a README based on the comments found in those files.

### Navigate to Your Project Directory

Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of your project:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
```
## Run the Command
Execute the `auto-readme-creator` command:

```bash
auto-readme-creator
```

## How It Works
auto-readme-creator performs the following tasks:

- Scans Code Files: It searches through your code files (e.g., .js, .ts, etc.) in the src directory (or a directory specified in your project).
- Extracts Comments: It extracts comments formatted as documentation.
- Generates README: It creates a README.md file with a summary of the extracted comments, organizing them into sections.

## Adding npm Global Bin Directory to PATH

To ensure that globally installed npm packages are accessible from the command line, you may need to add the npm global bin directory to your PATH environment variable. Here’s how to do it on Windows and macOS:

### On Windows

1. **Find the npm Global Directory**

   Run the following command in your terminal to find the global npm directory:

```bash
   npm config get prefix
```
This will return a path, such as `C:\Users\YourUsername\AppData\Roaming\npm.`

2. **Add the Directory to PATH**

  - Open the Start Menu and search for "Environment Variables".
  - Click on "Edit the system environment variables."
  - In the System Properties window, click on the "Environment Variables" button.
  - In the Environment Variables window, find the "Path" variable under "System variables" and select it.
 - Click "Edit."
 - Click "New" and add the path you obtained from the npm config get prefix command.
 - Click "OK" to close all dialogs.

 ## On macOS
1. **Find the npm Global Directory**

 Run the following command in your terminal to find the global npm directory:

 ```bash
    npm config get prefix
```
This will return a path, such as /usr/local.

2. **Add the Directory to PATH**
- Open your terminal.

-  your shell profile file (`.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`, or `.bashrc` depending on your shell) using a text editor. For example:

```bash
   nano ~/.bash_profile
```
- Add the following line to include the npm global bin directory in your PATH:

```bash
   export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/bin
```
